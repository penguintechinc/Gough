"""Baseline migration: full schema from ORM models.

Revision ID: 20260805_1000_baseline

Create Date: 2026-08-05 10:00:00.000000

Gough has never gone to production -- there is no migrated database whose
history must be preserved. This migration replaces the entire prior chain
(which had drifted from the ORM models and never applied cleanly against a
fresh database -- missing/renamed tables, wrong FK targets, an unusably
short alembic_version.version_num column, a literal-string database name in
a GRANT statement) with a single baseline that builds the schema directly
from app.models_sqlalchemy.Base (which app.models_m1 registers all M1 tables
onto) and app.db.init_db.Base. This guarantees model/migration parity by
construction: every column type, default, and index is exactly what the
models declare, including the dialect-guarded constructs already present in
the models (nodes.hardware_tags JSONB+GIN, joiner_secrets partial indexes,
webhook_endpoints JSONB) -- so this migration is portable across PostgreSQL,
MySQL/MariaDB Galera, and SQLite the same way the models already are.

Three tables are used at runtime via penguin-dal but have no SQLAlchemy
model in either Base (pre-existing gap, not introduced here -- see
tests/pg_fixtures.py's module docstring): ``vault_bootstrap_tokens``,
``alert_rules``, ``upgrade_runs``. Their DDL is carried over verbatim from
the migrations that used to create them so those tables keep being created;
giving them proper models is a follow-up, not done here.

Also carries over, verbatim in intent, four PostgreSQL views, five DB roles
with grants, and row-level-security policies that were previously created by
dedicated migrations -- none of this is representable in SQLAlchemy
metadata, so it runs as raw postgres-only ``op.execute()`` calls after the
model-driven ``create_all()``. The database-name GRANT bug (a literal
"current_database" identifier instead of the actual database name) is fixed
here rather than carried over.

    """Grant USAGE + SELECT on every SERIAL/IDENTITY sequence backing a
    column of each table in ``tables``, for ``role`` (gh-22, FIX 5).

    Postgres-only (see the ``dialect != 'postgresql'`` guard around this
    function's only call site) -- MariaDB's ``AUTO_INCREMENT`` has no
    sequence object to grant on at all, so this concept doesn't apply
    there.

    Why this exists: ``GRANT ... ON <table> TO <role>`` does NOT include
    privileges on the sequence backing that table's autoincrement column.
    Without ``USAGE`` on the sequence, every INSERT relying on the
    column's ``nextval(...)`` DEFAULT fails with "permission denied for
    sequence <name>" even when the table grant is otherwise perfectly
    correct -- discovered via ``node_events`` (gh-22 FIX 4), then found to
    apply identically to every other SERIAL-PK table this role can INSERT
    into (``nodes`` reproduces the same failure). ``SELECT`` is additionally
    required because penguin-dal's ``insert()`` compiles to SQLAlchemy's
    ``INSERT ... RETURNING``, and Postgres requires SELECT privilege on any
    column named in a RETURNING clause -- including the sequence-backed PK
    column being returned.

    Derived dynamically per table/column via ``pg_get_serial_sequence``
    rather than a hand-maintained table-type list -- roughly half of this
    role's INSERT-granted tables use a UUID or string PK with no sequence
    at all (``joiner_secrets``, ``audit_events``, ``storage_backends``,
    ``migration_events``, ``migration_policy``, ``dr_drills``) or a
    composite/FK-derived PK with no *owned* sequence (``node_bmc``,
    ``leader_leases``) -- ``pg_get_serial_sequence`` returns NULL for all
    of those and they're silently skipped, exactly the "no sequence" case
    this must handle gracefully. Least-privilege: only sequences backing
    tables this specific role actually has INSERT on, nothing broader.

    # this table specifically while getting one on every other RLS-enabled
    # table via the generic tenant_isolation policy above. Editing the
