"""Regression guard: gh-22 (event-loop-unblocking sweep, Parts 1-4).

No direct, synchronous penguin-dal execution may appear directly inside an
``async def`` function body -- every blocking penguin-dal call must run
inside a ``run_db()`` (or bare ``asyncio.to_thread()``) closure, per the
house pattern documented in ``app/db/run_db.py``. This service is
single-process/single-loop (gRPC shares it -- see ``app/grpc_server.py``),
so a synchronous multi-millisecond DB call sitting directly in a coroutine
stalls every other request and RPC until it returns.

Detection strategy (AST, not line-count/regex):

Walk every ``async def`` in ``app/`` (at any nesting depth, including
decorator-produced wrapper coroutines such as ``require_auth``'s
``decorated_function`` or ``_require_cluster_tenant``'s ``_wrapper``).
Within each async function's own statements -- but *not* descending into a
nested ``def``/``lambda`` (that's precisely the run_db()/to_thread()
closure the house pattern hands off to a worker thread) -- track which
local names are penguin-dal handles:

* ``db`` and ``get_db`` are always treated as handles -- ``db`` by the
  codebase's universal convention for the value returned by ``get_db()``,
  and ``get_db`` itself so a chained ``get_db()(...).select()`` (skipping
  the usual ``db = get_db()`` assignment) is still caught.
* Any name assigned ``= get_db()``.
* Any name assigned a bare call on an already-tracked handle, e.g.
  ``query = db(...)`` (PyDAL's ``db(query)`` returns a lazy ``Set`` --
  itself non-blocking -- so the *assignment* doesn't blindly get flagged;
  what matters is whether a terminal method is later invoked on it,
  in or out of a closure).
* The ``as`` target of ``with <handle>.transaction() as tx:``.

Deliberately *not* tracked: ``table = db.storage_config`` (a Table handle)
is not propagated as a tracked name, even though ``db.table.insert(...)``
chained directly off ``db`` in one expression is still caught. Table
objects expose both a genuinely blocking ``.insert()`` and entirely
non-blocking field/query-builder methods (``table.column.belongs([...])``,
``table.column.contains(...)``, comparisons) -- the ``table = db.X``
pattern is used throughout this codebase exclusively for the latter (see
``app/api/biomes.py``'s ``list_biomes``), so tracking it would flag pure
query-condition construction as a false positive far more often than it
would ever catch a real violation.

Then flag any call of the shape ``<tracked-handle>.<anything>(...)``
appearing directly in the async body (not inside a nested def/lambda) --
that covers ``db(...).select()/.update()/.delete()/.count()/.first()``,
``db.table.insert(...)``, ``db.table(id)`` (PyDAL's non-lazy row-by-id
shorthand), ``db.commit()/.rollback()/.executesql()/.transaction()``, and
the same on a tracked alias (``query.select()``, ``tx.executesql()``).

Known, accepted limitation: this is same-function, same-statement-tree
analysis, not cross-function dataflow. A handle threaded through an
*external* helper function's return value (e.g.
``assign_tbl, _ = _get_assignments_table(db)`` in ``app/api/nodes.py``)
is not traced -- exactly like ``test_no_direct_sqlalchemy_runtime.py``'s
regex approach, this test does not attempt full semantic analysis. In
every case audited during the Part 1-4 sweep, calls reached that way are
already inside a run_db()-wrapped closure at their point of use; if a
future change moves one out, this test's coverage of the *directly*
reachable 95% of call sites is still what catches the overwhelming
majority of regressions, and code review covers the rest.

No allowlist: the Part 4 sweep (gh-22) found zero call sites that
genuinely can't be expressed as a run_db()/to_thread() closure.
