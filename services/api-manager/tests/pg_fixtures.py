"""Real-Postgres test fixtures.

Reuses ``$DATABASE_URL`` when present (CI service container); otherwise spins
an ephemeral ``postgres:16-bookworm`` container via testcontainers for the
duration of the pytest session.

Schema is built exactly once per session by running the real Alembic
migration chain (``alembic upgrade head``, currently a single baseline --
``alembic/versions/20260805_1000_baseline_full_schema.py``) against the
target database. This is the same migration that builds production schema
(62 tables, 4 views, RLS policies, per-service DB roles), so this fixture and
production share one schema authority instead of drifting via a hand-rolled
``Base.metadata.create_all()``. Function-scoped ``pg_db`` gets per-test
isolation by TRUNCATE-ing every data table between tests rather than
re-running migrations per test, which would be both slow and unnecessary --
the schema itself never changes mid-session.

    from the parsed ``pg_url`` before invoking it, then restore whatever was
    there beforehand so this doesn't leak into other tests/fixtures.

    ``env.py`` also calls ``logging.config.fileConfig()``, which -- with its
    default ``disable_existing_loggers=True`` -- permanently disables every
    ``logging.Logger`` already registered under a name not listed in
    ``alembic.ini``'s ``[loggers]`` section (only ``root``, ``sqlalchemy``,
    ``alembic`` are). A real, subprocess ``alembic upgrade head`` never
    surfaces this (nothing else shares that process' logging state), but
    running it in-process here would otherwise silently and permanently mute
    every other module's logger for the rest of the pytest session (caught
    empirically: it broke an unrelated ``caplog`` assertion elsewhere in the
    suite). Re-enable anything fileConfig newly disabled once the upgrade is
    done, leaving loggers that were already disabled beforehand alone.
